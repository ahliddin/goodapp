## Project test branch

### How to run tests

After cloning the project make sure to switch to the master-test branch:

`git checkout master-test`

Running tests from maven:

`mvn clean test`

For better visual effects you can as well import the project as Maven project into JBoss Developer Studio and run the project as JUnit Test.
